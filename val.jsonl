In an application process your grant would have been denied right here. Follow instructions.\n• This asked for your Mission Statement Only.  No more, no less. Follow the instructions.\n• You can’t empower people. You can give them skills, tools, knowledge, etc. but it’s up to them to be empowered.\n• Your target audience is too broad. Pick one specific age group. Funders are specific, you will increase your funding when you are specific about your audience. You cannot serve everyone. *Watch the video!\n• How do you measure “brighter” and “sustainable”? These are subjective. Consider words that a Funder doesn’t have to wonder what it means.\n• Your funder needs to know what your focus is. What is a brighter future? Financial stability. Generational wealth. Breaking the cycle of poverty. Whatever “It” is, we need to know. This is how funders determine funding alignment.\n• Use third person, not first person.\n• What happened in these gatherings? What does the Black Resource Guide contain? Don’t make your Funders guess.\n• Does this mean the organization creates connections within the Black community or the organization connects to the Black community?\n• This is the answer to the next question. \n\nPay close attention to the question and Only answer the question.\n\nThe answer should be securing affordable office space. And, maybe, explain why that was a challenge. *The second paragraph: the organization requires a dedicated kitchen to administer the culinary courses, etc.\n• How does kitchen space support entrepreneurial “aspects” of the curriculum? \n\nDoes it provide participants a space to run their entrepreneurial businesses?\n• What are building projects? Why do they require open space?\n• This is the answer to the next question. \n\nPay close attention to the question and Only answer the question.\n\nThe answer should be securing affordable office space. And, maybe, explain why that was a challenge. *The second paragraph: the organization requires a dedicated kitchen to administer the culinary courses, etc.\n• I’d move this to another section. The goal of this section is to demonstrate the organization’s ability to overcome a challenge. Race may be an area of contention given the current climate.\n• The question asked for the organization’s Greatest. Not a list of each accomplishment over the years. This would have gotten your application rejected. Answer the question. \n\nPick what you believe is the Greatest accomplishment.\n• This answer is confusing. Is EmpowerED a program?\n• Including specific zip codes is going to limit your funding ability. This is too narrow. I’d stick with the City of Long Beach. That’s narrow enough.\n• Is there a way to tie these into Youth Leadership training somehow? You have too large of a target population: 12 - 25+ requires too many staff. Think about it - there are several age development stages just in the 12 - 21 (12-13 tweens; 14-16 teens; 17-19 young adults; 201-25 Adults; over 25 you go into so many different life stages. For a funder to feel comfortable with your organization serving so many different age groups, you need to have Trained staff for each stage, materials and supples for each program, and on and on. Grouping all of these folks together doesn’t acknowledge the different life challenges each group experiences. If your budget is under $1 million, funders are going to look at you sideways. \nSubject Matter Experts, not staff Doing All The Things.\n• Can you make this fit the parameters of the question? For example, there were 8 meetings conducted within the grant period. Was that a year? If so, the answer would be 1,200 per year. Not the number of meetings.\n• The question does not ask how many resource guides the agency distributed. ONLY answer the question that is asked.\n• The question does not ask for All of this. Just the number served and the time frame. Stop adding extra information. It’s going to get your application rejected for Not following the guidelines.\n• Refer to the examples provided in grey. They are high level descriptions, not the minute details you provide. Model the example, They give them for a reason.\n• What are impractical financial skills? Delete practical\n• How do you measure confidence\n• The question does not ask for an explanation on how basic life skills lead to financial stability and independence. It asks for what makes the program Innovative. If this question was worth 25 points your answer would have received “0”. Answer the question.\n• Why basic? Why not just Life Skills? Basic takes away from the impact.\n• Consider this for the Innovation\n• Never promise 100%. \n1. Because life happens, and outside variables may impact a participant’s ability to participate. You can’t control that. \n2. Leave opportunities to ask for more money. If you can do everything with this grant, they don’t need to give you more money. Promise low, deliver medium.\n• Do not make your goals two or three part. Keep all goals single because they cannot be properly evaluated. For example, how do you evaluate success if Half of your participants don’t plan a meal? Or half don’t prepare a meal? Or if the meals aren’t all nutritious? Or aren’t all healthy? Or don’t meat the requirements of “on a budget”. Too many variables could throw off the evaluation.\n• These don’t tie into your mission.\n• This is not a goal, rather a method for understanding credit and debt management.\n• This doesn’t tie into your mission\n• How would you measure practical aspects of adult life? Funders are left to guess.\n• Participation is not a fundable goal. Participation shows a funder that the goal was achieved.\n• This is the How, not the what.\n\nFor example, The Goal (what) could be to increase access and exposure to nontraditional, high-paying careers. The Objective (how) could be through mentorship (paring youth with professionals in nontraditional, high paying careers).\n• Did you read this?\n• How do these objectives HELP to prove the goals were accomplished? \n\nHow does tracking the number of youth registered prove that 5 healthy and nutritious meals were created on a budget?\n\nHow does “monitoring” attendance prove that participants acquired financial literacy skills?\n\nThese aren’t lining up.\n\nSet your goals, the % of the success rate, then How those goals will be achieved (objectives)\n• The goals were requested earlier. This question is asking your to provide a narrative description of the program\n• This needs a new name. It doesn’t come off as a program. Funders don’t want to fund a hack session.\n• Cooking?\n• Managing?\n• Are they still being hosted? The sounds as if they happened back in 2024. Are they ongoing. If so, remove the 2024 for clarity.\n\nESD hosts Community and Engagement  meetings, called Black Magic Gatherings because magic happens when the community works together.\n• The question is what are the “services provided”. Not what was established or what acts were the largest in the history of the parade. Or, if the celebration came in on budget. Answer the question.\n• These are the “How”, the question asks for the what. Answer the question.\n• Is a funder going to pay to “address” what does that mean?\n• Separate the two\n• Separate the two\n• Separate the two\n• Should a Funder pay for “at least” Make your goals precise so that a Funder is clear about what they’re paying for.\n• This needs to be measurable\n• Funders don’t fund initiatives. Programs\n• Is it three each? Break these up. What if you don’t hit one of the the 3? How will this be measured?\n• How do you measure “track and report on”? You could produce a quarterly report (4 per year) that lists the voting\n• The question in not what is being done (6 meetings). Answer the question.\n• Suggests that you want to do it. Funders want to know you’re doing it.\n\nConsider, The program fosters equitable opportunities for Black residents that strengthens the economic well-being of the community . . .\n• How would a Funder quantify this? What would say “We were successful in accomplishing this?”\n• What does this look like? You’re making the Funder guess. Make it clear . . ."}

Only 5 were requested. Legal reason to eliminate your application before it got to the good part!\n• What’s your ultimate goal? I can’t tell from your mission statement. I read the what, but WHY? What’s missing? Why do marginalized communities need to feel loved, valued, and connected? IF those things happened, what would the current condition be?\n\nSimple mission: End childhood cancer.\n\nIf all the research, therapy, etc. worked, then childhood cancer would no longer exist. We know who the target audience is. We know what the issue is. And we know if we are successful, what no longer would be.\n• Stop including what is not requested. What was asked for was a mission statement. Your application would have been rejected for not following instructions.\n• Did you want to specify African American people?\n• Unless you want to specifically speak to the African American community?\n\nYou could say Daysha wanted to create a safe, culturally affirming space that celebrates emotional wellbeing, holistic wellness and the uniqueness of the African American community.\n• As a rule, use Third person.\n• You’re leaving the funder to guess what these are. Either state them so the funder isn’t left to figure out what the are, or don’t mention them.\n• Opportunities is your catch word. You use it over and over . . . find a new word. As a matter of fact Describe what the “opportunity” is. \n\nIn this instance what are the wellness ACTIVITIES, EVENTS, just say it: Skate fitness programs, Dance fitness programs . . . stop making the funder Guess what’s going on.\n• Are these the events?

My suggestion is that you focus on one age group either youth or seniors. The goal is still to promote intergenerational connectedness, but pick a population. \n\nA Funder wants to focus on one group\n• The question is who is your target population. Just answer the question. Move the explanation of How you deliver your programs down to that question.\n• Duplicated (the same, recurring) or\nUnduplicated (different) participants?\n• What makes this innovative? Speak to the outcomes.\n• Is this 2x a month or every other month? Clarify\n• How?\n• Let the program do its own tooting. Stating that a program is unlike another dance program or calling it innovative is unnecessary. The description should show it.\n• What specifically is going on? Webinars? Services? Mental health counseling? Spa day? Treatments? You’re making the funder guess. Just tell them.\n• What does this mean?\n• But centers Blackness\n• ????\n• What does the pre post survey say? \n\nConsider *Upon completion of the program 70% of program participants will increase their physical activity by 20%.\n\nParticipants will be able to identify 3 sources that deliver physical fitness activities or will participate in 5 events.\n\nParticipants will be able to identify 3 sources that offer emotional wellness activities or will participate in 3 events.\n\nDecrease Isolation: Participants will be able to identify 5 sources for accessing community activities or will participate in 3 activities. \n\nYou can quantify sources. It’s hard to quantify Isolation except to show how your program will help them to be in community.\n• How would a Funder measure “at least”? It either is or isn’t\n• What is this?\n• Refer to examples in Program 1\n• Clarify: 2x per month or every other month\n• How will you accomplish your goals? That’s all the question asks.\n• I need to feel the need to give you money. This doesn’t do it. What would change as a result of youth participating in this program? What Societal issue does this address?\n• What kind of skills? Stop making your funder guess.\n• How do you measure confidence and connection? And, why is it important?\n• Undecided on structure. Should this be under the Non-profit or formed as a separate LLC.\n• How do you quantify this? And really, can you control this? Consider\n\nIncrease culturally-affirming healthcare practices by healthcare providers. 80% of ObGyns will be able to identify 5 culturally affirming practices that lead to positive health outcomes.\n\n90% of Birthing moms will be able to list 5 clarifying questions to ask their ObGyn that will lead to improved health outcomes.\n• How do you measure something that didn't occur. Do I assume that it not occurring is due to the program intervention.\n• What are the SERVICES? You’re making the funder Guess\n• Funders need a start and end date. You can say Annually (ex: 3 Black mothers per year)\n• Speak as if it already has happened. Funders want to fund organizations with a track record."}
