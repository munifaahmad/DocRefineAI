This group is inclusive of all Black people and welcoming of groups of other racial identities. Our programs and services are designed to be trauma-conscious, physically accessible, and priced appropriately for low-income community members.\nBlack Wellbeing Practitioners - Black identifying local practitioners (e.g: yoga teachers, meditation teachers, therapists, social workers, counselors, acupuncturists, doulas and midwives, reiki masters, masseurs, etc) offering healing services to community members, who are also interested in trauma-conscious continuing education, cultivating professional community, and seeking wellbeing for themselves.

This lack of representation and negligence is failing them, affecting their overall well-being on a multigenerational level and they want to break that cycle starting with their own healing.\nThrough mindfulness and holistic practices (i.e. yoga, psychology, meditation, and more) we aim to remedy the lack of representation and reflection of the Black experience in the health care and wellness industry in our community of Los Angeles and Inglewood.

The Wellness Tour was a free immersive community-led experience designed to deepen mindfulness-based practices in the South Los Angeles area. The tour offered activations and workshops led by community members and wellness practitioners while partnering with local businesses, organizations, and city agencies. During the tour week – we employed nearly 30 local wellness practitioners, artists, and thought-leaders from the community to share their gifts. Over 500 people attended our workshops over the 7-days. Tour attendees repeatedly asked us “what’s next for South LA Wellness?” – Black Being is our answer. Black Being was born out of the need of Black people of South Los Angeles to have a dedicated space to access wellbeing programming.\nWhat has been the organization's biggest program challenge?\nOne of the major barriers we have had for our programs is access to available physical space. Even if attendance was high\nwe were often left with multi-use spaces or outdoor parks which meant if the space was unavailable, the programs could not operate and if weather didn’t permit, we would be forced to cancel. Additionally, accessibility needs could not be met.\nHow has the organization overcome that challenge?\nMuch of our in-person programs were halted by COVID, but offered us an opportunity to offer programming online. Although still inaccessible to many within our community.\nWhat is the organization's greatest accomplishment since its incorporation?\nWe acquired our first multi-year donation. This donation has helped us to acquire a physical brick and mortar space which we will now house our programs and classes. The space offers us an opportunity to lead classes for people with limited mobility with use or props and an indoor space.", "output": "Black Being Organizational Profile\nUpdated: October 1, 2023\nTo encourage physical, mental, and emotional wellbeing, through practices and programs anchored in culture and ancestral wisdoms."}
